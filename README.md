## Make Change project

### Description

This project is a simulation POS register allowing the operator to
* Enter the total purchase price or a transaction.
* Prompts tender amount from customer.
* Returns total price.
* And denotes individual nominations to return to the customer if change is due at the end of sale.
 --Invalid user input returns abort transactions / management overrides / and re-entries.
### Topics and Technologies Used

* Calling Methods

* Conditionals (if/else)

* Looping (while loops)

* Constant variables

* Java math floor and round functions

* Switch

(Stay tuned for ASCII implementations!)
### How to Run

* Run the application by launching.
* Once the program has launched you will be prompted asking the price of the item.
* Once a valid price is submitted the user presses [enter].
* The user will be prompted asking the amount tendered. Once typed, the user presses [enter].
* Upon pressing [enter] with the correct tender amount change due will be displayed.
* Below change due are denominations most suitable for the user to return to the customer.
  based off of the change due.


### Lessons Learned

* If something has to be forced in order to work it is best to take a step back in order
to analyze different possible routes that solve the problem with a better design principle.

* Create a functioning program prior to delving into user input break concerns.
  It is easier to analyze potential falls when the whole structure is there to analyze.

* Constant variables help tremendously with creating safer code regarding final values.
