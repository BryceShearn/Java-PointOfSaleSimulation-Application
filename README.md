      This Application is a POS register simulator that allows the operator to
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
       * Enter the total purchase price of a transaction.* Prompts tender amount from customer.* Returns total price.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      * denotes individual nominations to return to the customer if change is due at the end of sale.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      * --Invalid user input returns abort transactions / management overrides / and re-entries.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<i></i>
### Technologies Used
<br />
* <i></i>    

    * Calling Methods

    * Conditionals (if/else)

    * Looping (while loops)

    * Constant variables

    * Java math floor and round functions

    * Switch

### Lessons Learned
<br />
* <i></i>

    * If something has to be forced in order to work it is best to take a step back in order
      to analyze different possible routes that solve the problem with a better design principle.

    * Create a functioning program prior to delving into user input break concerns.
      It is easier to analyze potential falls when the whole structure is there to analyze.

    * Constant variables help tremendously with creating safer code regarding final values.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* Run the application by launching.
    * Once the program has launched you will be prompted asking the price of the item.
    * Once a valid price is submitted the user presses [enter].
    * The user will be prompted asking the amount tendered. Once typed, the user presses [enter].
    * Upon pressing [enter] with the correct tender amount change due will be displayed.
    * Below change due are denominations most suitable for the user to return to the customer.
      based off of the change due.
